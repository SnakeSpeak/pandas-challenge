Summary of Analysis
In this district, there are two types of schools: Charters and District. Charter schools typically have
lower student counts, being as low as 427, while Districts typically have higher student totals, being as high
as 4976. Charters tend to typically have better overall passing rates than District schools.

Conclusions
1. The passing rates for math and reading for District schools are significantly
lower than those of Charter schools, ~66 % and ~53 % for District, as opposed to those
of Charters' ~93 % and ~90 %, respectively. However, there doesn't appear to be a direct
correlation of passing rates to per capita, it appears to be the inverse. Schools that spend 
$585 or less have a higher overall passing rate of 90 % and schools that spend $645-680 have a meager
53 % overall passing rate. 

2. The top 5 performing schools of the district are all charters, while the bottom 5 are all
district school. Interestingly the bottom 5 schools have more of a school budget, ranging from
$1.88 million to $3.09 million, as opposed to the top 5's more humble $585k to $1.31 million budgets.
The student totals of the bottom 5 are also much larger, with the most bottom school having a student total
of 4761, so perhaps it's not a lack of money that could be to blame for poor scores and grades, but perhaps
overcrowded schools.

3. Between Charters and District schools, they have the same avearge Math and Reading scores,
however their passing math and reading percentages are very different, with Charters having passing per-
centages in the >90s, while District schools are <67. Could be due to overall grade in math and reading, but 
performing well in tests.
